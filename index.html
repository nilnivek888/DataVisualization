					This is a grouped bar chart showing the production budgets
					and global box office revenues of all the movies in the
					Marvel Cinematic Universe. My graph is created using the d3
					library. The data is from Kaggle.com.
				</p>
				<p>
					The x-axis lists all the movies in the order of which they
					are released. In each group, there are 2 bars. The blue bars
					stands for the production budget and the orange ones for
					global box office revenue. The y-axis shows the amount of
					money in millions of USD. Only the production budgets and
					global box office revenue is used as a subset of the data.
				</p>
				<p>
					Clearly, one can see that "Avengers: End Game" has both the
					most budget and most revenue. Also, the box office revenue
					varies more that the production budget does. This graph
					shows the rankings among the movies in the MCU. It also show
					the difference between revenue and budget for each movie
					(profit).
